# Hangman Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Hangman game in Python. The game allows a player to guess a word by suggesting letters within a certain number of attempts.

## Features

- **Random Word Selection**: Utilizes the `random` library to select a word from a predefined list.
- **ASCII Art**: Displays hangman stages and a game logo using ASCII art from the `hangman_art` module.
- **Game Loop**: Implements a `while` loop to manage game states and user interactions.
- **Conditional Logic**: Checks for win/lose conditions and handles user input validation.
- **Tracking Guessed Letters**: Keeps track of letters guessed by the player to avoid repetition.
- **Visual Feedback**: Provides visual feedback on the current state of the word being guessed and remaining lives.
